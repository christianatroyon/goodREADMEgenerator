# goodREADMEgenerator

This application was created to try out my new skills using node.js! With this application, users can create a README file for their repository right from the command line, using the guidelines set forth by the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide). This will hopefully allow some developers to save some time and make sure they aren't missing any vital sections that should be included in a professional README file.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

The following [animation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jLIOnshcHv6LgSYnVJFpsFE_D7noUj_W/view) demonstrates the application functionality:
